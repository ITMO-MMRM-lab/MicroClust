### *MicroClust V1.0* is a python based toolbox that performs classificaiton of small scale surface images using Unsupervised clustering algorithims

Images from Atomic force microsope (AFM), scanning electorn microsope (SEM) etc, can be classifed using 12 of the most widely used clustering algorithims and further validated using Ground truth and self-evaluatory metrics. The toolbox can perform a 1D and 2D Fourier transform on the image data prior to classification. 


#### Algorithims available are: 
 1. K Means 
 2. K Means ++ 
 3. K Means Bisect
 4. Hierarchy 
 5. Fuzzy C Means
 6. Spectral 
 7. DBSCAN (Automated & Manually tuned) 
 8. HDBSCAN 
 9. Mean Shift
 10. OPTICS
 11. Affinity Propagation
 12. BIRCH 

#### Metrics available: 
Ground Truth evaluation: 
 1. Rand Index
 2. Adjusted Rand Index
 3. Adjusted Mutual Information Score
 4. Homogeneity
 5. Completeness
 6. V Measure
 7. Fowlkes Mallows Score
    
Self-Evaluation:
 1. Silhouette Score
 2. Calinski Harabasz Index
 3. Davies Bouldin Index
 
 

 The tooblbox features 12 algorithims and 10 metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the generated results. 


 The **V1.0** version is a first level iteration of the toolbox. Here, the use
 

A Tool that aims to serve chemsists & give them insight on their AFM scans for further analysis. In-Progress...
